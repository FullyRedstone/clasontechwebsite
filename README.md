# Clason Tech Website
## Developed by *Jonathyn Stiverson*
### Created with HTML and CSS
#### In the code for the website there will be comments 
#### explaining what each part does and why we used each
#### part.  If you have any questions, feel free to email
#### about the questions to Clason Tech and we will try 
#### to reply.  This is hosted on github so anyone can
#### look at it and see how we did it and so they can
#### perhaps use some of the code in their own website
#### design.  If you have any tips how we can make it 
#### more clear of what to do, feel free to email us.
#### Thank you for you support!

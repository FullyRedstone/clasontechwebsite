            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to create websites and applications in a reasonable amount of time for reasonable prices with great customer satisfaction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!--Second section of the main content, ideally for the css-->
        <div class="sectionTwo">
            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>We create websites and applications at a affordable price and deliver top of the line customer service.  We understand the struggles of time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!--Third section of the main content-->
        <div class="sectionThree">
            <h3>What do we use?</h3>
            <p>We are willing to use any website development software such as wix, squarespace or wordpress, although we prefer to just code it in html and css.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!--Fourth section-->
        <div class="sectionSeven">
            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <h3>Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, ect</h3>
            <p>For easy site creation software the pricing is pretty cheap.  The standard cost is 80$.  Plus any more for any other features.  Note when using these it costs more per month to host the website than coding it would.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!--Fifth section-->
        <div class="sectionEight">
            <h3>Coding it in html and css</h3>
            <p>Since this takes a lot more time and effort than using a site creator, the pricing is going to be a lot higher.  The standard price is 200$ for just html and css.  If you would like java-script and a interactive experience, this can take much longer and is more complex.  For those projects there is an additional 200$.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!--Sixth Section-->
        <div class="sectionNine">
            <h3>Hosting the website using our web servers.</h3>
            <p>Have we coded your site in html or you have an html version of your site but nowhere to host it?  Well come no farther.  We have an initial charge of 10$ a month for hosting the site, plus 1$ per 100 visitors a day.  Also depending on how big the site is (file size), we may charge more per month due to limited storage capacity.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!--Seventh Section-->
        <div class="sectionTen">
            <h3>Minecraft Servers</h3>
            <p>We are even willing to create a minecraft server for you.  Depending on the type of server prices will vary.  The initial price will be 200$ since it takes a lot of time to create the server.  We are also willing to host the server for negotiable specs and prices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sectionEleven">
            <h3>Software and application development</h3>
            <p>Since software and application development takes a lot of time and a lot of effort, the pricing for application development is a lot more.  The initial charge is 400$, plus 100$ per two weeks on the application development.</p>
